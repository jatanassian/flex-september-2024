# Breakout - Team Git Workflow

### To Do

- [ ] Git vs Github
- [ ] Cloning vs Forking
- [ ] Merge Conflicts
- [ ] Team Git Workflow
- [ ] Other People's Branches

### Git vs GitHub

- git is version control software installed on your computer
- git allows a develpoer to store incremental changes to code (commits) over time
- Changes are stored locally in a directory called `.git`
- GIthub = a place that's remote from our computer, runs on the web

### Cloning vs Forking

- cloning => copy of a repo from GitHub to your local machine
- forking => creates a copy of a repo on GitHub
- "Use this template" button => doesn't contain the commit history

### Merge Conflicts

- two or more devs changing the code
- accept the current changes => keep my code
- accept the incoming changes => keep the code I'm pulling down
- accept both
- collaborate with the other dev

### Team Git Workflow

- one team member is going to use this template and own the repo
- add the other devs as collaborators
